# image-fetch
See how long an image has been fetched from server and showed on screen

The purpose of this is to monitor if someone opened my email and the image in that email has been fetched from server. 
Since some email clients disabled image loading by default, this method is not 100% reliable, but combined with some other methods, the result should be good.

However...
I have no idea how to do this...
